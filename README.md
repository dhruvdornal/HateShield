# üõ°Ô∏è HateShield ‚Äì Real-Time Hate Speech Detection Extension

**HateShield** is a browser extension that detects and censors hate speech in real-time as you browse social media platforms like X (Twitter), Reddit, and Instagram. Powered by a TensorFlow LSTM model and served through a Flask backend, HateShield helps create a safer online experience by automatically filtering offensive content.

- **Simple Controls**: Easy to enable/disable filtering with a toggle switch

## üìã Requirements

- Google Chrome or any Chromium-based browser (Edge, Brave, etc.)
- Node.js and npm (for development only)

## üîç How It Works

1. HateShield monitors text content on supported websites
2. When new content appears, it sends the text to be analyzed by our API
3. The TensorFlow LSTM model evaluates the text for hate speech
4. If offensive content is detected, HateShield censors it in real-time
5. Users can click on censored content to reveal it if desired
